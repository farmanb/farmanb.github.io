    Construction Zone Compound — a temporary tetrahedral installation by
    Glen Whitney (Studio Infinity) during the First-Year Projects Showcase
  </em>
</p>

**[Studio Infinity](https://studioinfinity.org) founder Glen Whitney** visited Louisiana Tech University to lead the construction of a large-scale mathematical art installation on campus during the **First-Year Projects Showcase**.

### A mathematical structure at architectural scale
The installation—a compound of five tetrahedra—highlighted the symmetry and structural richness of one of the Platonic solids. Built collaboratively on Thursday and disassembled Friday morning, the piece brought together students, faculty, and visitors in a hands-on exploration of three-dimensional geometry at architectural scale.

### Mathematics as a participatory experience
Studio Infinity’s work emphasizes mathematics as a physical, collaborative activity. By constructing temporary, large-scale installations, their projects make abstract mathematical ideas tangible, accessible, and socially engaging—inviting participants to experience mathematics through making, movement, and shared inquiry.

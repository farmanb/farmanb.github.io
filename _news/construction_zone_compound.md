title: Construction Zone Compound
---

Glen Whitney of [Studio Infinity](https://studioinfinity.org) visited Louisiana Tech University to lead the construction of a large-scale mathematical art installation on campus during the First-Year Projects Showcase.

The piece is a compound of five tetrahedra, showcasing the symmetry and structural richness of one of the Platonic solids. 
Built collaboratively on Thursday and disassembled Friday morning, this temporary installation brought together students, faculty, and visitors in a hands-on exploration of three-dimensional geometry at architectural scale.

Studio Infinity’s work highlights mathematics as a participatory, physical activity, using installations to make mathematics ideas tangible and accessible.

A proposal submitted to establish the Applied eXploration in Open Mathematics Lab (AXIOM Lab) at Louisiana Tech University has been awarded full funding through the Louisiana Board of Regents Support Fund – Departmental Enhancement Program.

The AXIOM Lab is designed as a dedicated research collaboration space within the Mathematics and Statistics program, aimed at supporting mentored undergraduate research, faculty–student collaboration, and community-building activities beyond the classroom. The project focuses on improving the quality and accessibility of research experiences, particularly for students preparing for senior capstone projects, conference presentations, and graduate study.

The proposal was highly recommended by the review panel and selected in a competitive statewide process. Funding will support the creation of a centralized lab space equipped for both in-person and remote collaboration, with planned programming including research seminars, workshops, industry engagement activities, and structured mentoring opportunities.

>This proposal seeks to establish and maintain a lab where students can engage in mentored research and collaborations with Math and Statistics faculty. 
>The primary goal is to improve undergraduate education and faculty research and development. Faculty are currently spread out amongst four buildings; the programs need a home where the students and faculty can interact and collaborate. 
>Establishing the lab will boost undergraduate students’ performance and research readiness and help with retention, along with faculty research and their ability to win external grants. 
>The work plan is well thought out, ambitious, and will improve students’ capstone projects and their ability to continue research or connect with industry. 
>The team will host a weekly departmental meeting where students and faculty can network and generate a feeling of community. 
>They will launch monthly streaming of the BIG (Business, Industry and Government) math network industry connection series, which are virtual interactive panels. 
>The evaluation plan is extensive, thoughtful, and measurable. 
>The team is capable of implementing the plan.
>The panel suggests allocating less funding to furniture and more to computer equipment to provide more capabilities to students and faculty. Full funding is recommended.

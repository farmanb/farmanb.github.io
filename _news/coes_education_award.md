### Why this award
The award specifically acknowledges their successful [Departmental Enhancement Grant]({% link _news/axiom.md %}), which established the **Applied eXploration in Open Mathematics (AXIOM) Lab**, as well as their role in facilitating the [Construction Zone Compound]({% link _news/construction_zone_compound.md %}), a mathematics art installation featured at the First-Year Projects Showcase.

Together, these projects reflect a shared commitment to creating accessible, hands-on learning environments that connect mathematical thinking with broader creative, engineering, and community contexts.
